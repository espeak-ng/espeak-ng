## Language Configuration File

In addition to command line options and language options explained elsewhere, 
language configurations can also be read from a file at startup.

The file espeak-ng-data/config uses the syntax of a language configuration file. 
It overwrites existing configuration.

### Examples

For supported options, see docs/voices.md.
For example language files, see files in espeak-ng-data/lang/*/*.
