 * Machine-independent I/O routines for IEEE floating-point numbers.
 *
 * NaN's and infinities are converted to HUGE_VAL or HUGE, which
 * happens to be infinity on IEEE machines.  Unfortunately, it is
 * impossible to preserve NaN's in a machine-independent way.
 * Infinities are, however, preserved on IEEE machines.
 *
 * These routines have been tested on the following machines:
 *    Apple Macintosh, MPW 3.1 C compiler
 *    Apple Macintosh, THINK C compiler
 *    Silicon Graphics IRIS, MIPS compiler
 *    Cray X/MP and Y/MP
 *    Digital Equipment VAX
 *
 *
 * Implemented by Malcolm Slaney and Ken Turkowski.
 *
 * Malcolm Slaney contributions during 1988-1990 include big- and little-
 * endian file I/O, conversion to and from Motorola's extended 80-bit
 * floating-point format, and conversions to and from IEEE single-
 * precision floating-point format.
 *
 * In 1991, Ken Turkowski implemented the conversions to and from
 * IEEE double-precision format, added more precision to the extended
 * conversions, and accommodated conversions involving +/- infinity,
 * NaN's, and denormalized numbers.
